### Project Description
A juicy burger appears in the center of the screen.
You can click or tap anywhere on the burger to take a bite ‚Äî literally removes that part!
Each bite triggers a chewing sound and shows a funny message like ‚ÄúCalories? Never heard of them.‚Äù
After a few bites, you‚Äôll hear a burping sound and a funny character will slide in saying ‚ÄúMan, stop eating!‚Äù
The burger never ends ‚Äî once it‚Äôs fully eaten, it regenerates!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Ever been so hungry and broke that you started imagining food on your screen?
Tired of being judged for devouring a whole burger in 10 seconds?
Wish your food could talk back?.Well, now it does.This project solves the very real (totally fake) problem of infinite hunger with zero calories by letting you:
Bite a burger wherever you want,Hear satisfying bite and burp sounds
Get roasted by a virtual dude for eating too much
And laugh at sassy burger messages that know your soul
Finally, a burger that‚Äôs 100% fun, 0% fat. üçîüí•
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This project is a fun, interactive burger-eating web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics the experience of taking bites from a burger image, plays sounds, and reacts to user actions in humorous ways.
